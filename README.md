# lilycurses
Bindings to the ncurses library for the lily programming language

A fairly incomplete set of bindings to the ncurses library. The bindings and documentation
were created using FascinatedBox's bindgen and docgen tools. This was written mostly to get more
familiar with writing bindings for lily.
